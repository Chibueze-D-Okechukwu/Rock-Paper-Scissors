# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is a very simple command line rock paper scissors game
When the program is run, the user is asked the user to pick an option between "R", "P" or "S"
If user's input is invalid (not amongst our options), an error message would be displayed and the user would be asked for their input again
The `choice` function from the inbuilt Python `random` module is used to make a choice for the CPU.
If there is a winner, the user would be asked if they want to end the program
If there's a tie, the game continues.
